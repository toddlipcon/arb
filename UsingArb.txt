== Introduction ==

ARB (Amie Review Board?) is our internal code review system. This document serves as a brief introduction to its functionality

=== Features/Operation ===

==== Code Review Policies ====

In order to reduce bugs in our code, we ensure that all code is looked at by at least two people. For each commit in {{{git}}}, a set of applicable developers is generated, and at least one of those developers must approve the commit before it can be pushed into the {{{main}}} repository.

==== .OWNERS Files ====

Each directory in a git repository may have a file called {{{.OWNERS}}} in it. These files determine the developers who may approve commits touching files inside that directory. For any section of code, at least two developers should be listed, since a commit may never be approved by its author. If a directory does not have a {{{.OWNERS}}} file, ARB will traverse the tree upwards until it finds one. For example, in {{{web/code/application/modules/facebook/}}} there is a file {{{.OWNERS}}} which contains:

{{{
jason
todd
}}}

Therefore, if someone commits a chunk of code which modifies {{{web/code/application/modules/facebook/controllers/CanvasController.php}}} then either {{{jason}}} or {{{todd}}} must approve that commit before it may be pushed to {{{main}}}. If the author of the commit is {{{jason}}}, then {{{todd}}} must approve it since {{{jason}}} may not approve his own commit.

== Installing ARB on a VM ==

 * As amiest:
{{{
cd ~
test ! -d arb && git clone ssh://janus.corp.amiestreet.com/files/git/repos/main/arb/
(cd arb && git-pull)
./arb/bin/arb-install
# Enter "y" when it asks "Is that okay?"
}}}

 * Edit {{{~/.profile}}} and add the line {{{export ARB_USER=jonah}}} or whoever you are.
 * Log out and back in, or do {{{source ~/.profile}}} to load that variable.
 * Run {{{hash -r}}} to load the new arb binaries into your path 

 * {{{su}}} to root and then:
{{{
/home/amiest/arb/bin/arb-install-deps
}}}
